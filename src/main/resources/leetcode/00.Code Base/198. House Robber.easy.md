##198. House Robber - easy - https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/
```
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

 

Constraints:

    0 <= nums.length <= 100
    0 <= nums[i] <= 400
```
##Solution 1: DP - Bottom Up - TC: O(n), SC: O(1)
### Step 1: Divide into sub problems: suppose k houses index from 0 to k-1
### the Kth house has 2 conditions: robbed or not-robbed
### Step 2: So f(k) = max(f(k-1), f(k-2) + h(k)) and handle special condition: when k=0 return 0, when k=1, return H(0)
### Step 3: iterate Bottom-Up: f(0) = H(0), f(1) = Max(H(0), H(1)), f(2)=Max(f(1), f(0) + H(2)), f(3) = Max(f(2), f(1)+H(3))...
### Step 4: optimize space(optional), we don't have to use an array to store all maximum values from House 1 to House K
### only f(n-1), f(n-2) which is prev and (prev of prev) is necessary

            dp1[i] = dp0[i-1] + num
            dp0[i] = max(dp0[i-1], dp1[i-1])

    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 1)
            return nums[0];
        int dp0 = 0, dp1 = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int tmp = dp1;
            dp1 = dp0 + nums[i];
            dp0 = Math.max(dp0, tmp);
        }
        return Math.max(dp0, dp1);
    }
```
##Solution 2: DP - Top Down (DFS) - TC: O(n), SC: O(n)
```
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;
        return dfs(nums, nums.length - 1, new Integer[nums.length]);
    }

    private int dfs(int[] nums, int i, Integer[] memo) {
        if (memo[i] == null) {
            if (i == 0) memo[0] = nums[0];
            if (i == 1) memo[1] = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);
            if (i > 1) memo[i] = Math.max(dfs(nums, i - 1, memo), dfs(nums, i - 2, memo) + nums[i]);
        }
        return memo[i];
    }
```
