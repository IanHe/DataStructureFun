##56. Merge Intervals - medium - https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/
```
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.

 

Constraints:

    intervals[i][0] <= intervals[i][1]
```
###Solution - Sort & Traverse - TC: O(N logN), SC: O(log N) - N is the length of the intervals
```
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        int i = 0;
        for (int[] interval : intervals) {
            if (intervals[i][1] >= interval[0]) {
                intervals[i][1] = Math.max(intervals[i][1], interval[1]);
            } else {
                i++;
                intervals[i][0] = interval[0];
                intervals[i][1] = interval[1];
            }
        }
        return Arrays.copyOf(intervals, i + 1);
    }
```
