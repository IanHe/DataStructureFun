##Semaphore
A semaphore is a very powerful synchronization construct. Conceptually, a semaphore maintains a set of permits. 
A thread calling acquireQ on a semaphore waits, if necessary, until a permit is available, and then takes it. 
A thread calling release() on a semaphore adds a permit and notifies threads waiting on that semaphore,
potentially releasing a blocking acquirer. 
###(The Java concurrency library provides a full-featured implementation of semaphores which should be used in practice.)
###java.util.concurrent.Semaphore
```
// simple implementation
class Semaphore {
    private final int MAX_AVAILABLE;
    private int taken;

    public Semaphore(int maxAvailable) {
        this.MAX_AVAILABLE = maxAvailable;
        this.taken = 0;
    }

    public synchronized void acquire() throws InterruptedException {
        while (this.taken == MAX_AVAILABLE) {
            wait();
        }
        this.taken++;
    }

    public synchronized void release() {
        this.taken--;

        this.notifyAll();
    }
}
```
