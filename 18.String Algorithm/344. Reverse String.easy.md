##344. Reverse String - easy - https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/
```
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:

Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```
###Solution
###Time Complexity: O(n/2), Space Complexity: O(1)
```
Code:
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        if (s == null || s.length == 0) return;
        int size = s.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < (size / 2); i++) {
            char tmp = s[i];
            s[i] = s[size - i - 1];
            s[size -i - 1] = tmp;
        }
    }
```
