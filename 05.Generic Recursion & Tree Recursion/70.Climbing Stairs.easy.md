##70. Climbing Stairs - Easy - https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/
```
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

 
Constraints:
    1 <= n <= 45
```

##The number of ways to climb to the n step: f(n) is equal to the f(n-1) + f(n-2)
##Solution 1: Tail Recursion - TC: O(N), SC: O(1) - (Do not use pure recursion - O(N^2))
```
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        return finonacci(n, 1, 1)
    }

    private int finonacci(int n, int pre, int cur){
        if(n <= 1) return cur;
        return Finonacci(n-1, cur, pre + cur)
    }
```
##Solution 2 - DP: Iteration - TC: O(N), SC: O(1)
```
public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 2) return n;
        int first = 1, second = 2, sum = 0;
        while (n-- > 2) {
            sum = first + second;
            first = second;
            second = sum;
        }
        return sum;
    }
```
