##70. Climbing Stairs - Easy - https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/
```
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

 
Constraints:
    1 <= n <= 45
```

## solution05: The number of ways to climb to the n step: f(n) is equal to the f(n-1) + f(n-2)
### Method 1: Pure Recursion - bad -- Time Complexity: O(n^2)  
```
 public static int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 1)
            return 1;
        if (n < 3)
            return n;
        return climbStairs(n - 1) + climbStairs(n - 2);
    }
```
### Method 2: Iteration -- Time Complexity: O(n)
```
public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 2)
            return n;
        int first = 1, second = 2, sum = 0;
        while (n-- > 2) {
            sum = first + second;
            first = second;
            second = sum;
        }
        return sum;
    }
```
