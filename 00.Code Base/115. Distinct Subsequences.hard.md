##115. Distinct Subsequences - hard - https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/
```
Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

It's guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^
Example 2:

Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

babgbag
^^ ^
babgbag
^^    ^
babgbag
^    ^^
babgbag
  ^  ^^
babgbag
    ^^^

###Solution - DP(Two Dimension Array) - TC: O(M * N), SC: O(M * N), M and N is the length of String S and T

#####DP Function: dp[i+1][j+1] means the times that S(0...j) contains(not equal) T(0...i)
#####if(S(j) == T(i)) dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + d[i-1][j-1]
#####else dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]
#####initialize the first line to be 1, because null or "" are subsequence of any String
```
    public int numDistinct(String s, String t) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) return 0;
        if (t == null || t.length() == 0) return s.length();
        // search in char[] is faster than String.charAt()
        char[] chS = s.toCharArray(), chT = t.toCharArray();
        int m = chT.length + 1, n = chS.length + 1;
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];

        // init the first line to be 1
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) dp[0][i] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            // j only need to start from i, can save TC
            for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                if (chT[i - 1] == chS[j - 1]) dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                else dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1];
            }
        }
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
