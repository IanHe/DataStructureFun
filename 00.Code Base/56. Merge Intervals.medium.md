##56. Merge Intervals - medium - https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/
```
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.

 

Constraints:

    intervals[i][0] <= intervals[i][1]
```
###Solution - Sort & Traverse
###Time Complexity: O(N logN), Space Complexity: O(log N) - N is the length of the intervals
```
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        // Arrays.sort: a Dual-Pivot Quicksort: O(n log(n)) 
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (arr1, arr2) -> (arr1[0] - arr2[0]));
        // result
        int[][] result = new int[intervals.length][2];
        int i = -1;
        for (int[] interval : intervals) {
            // when index start or the next one's first element is greater than the current one's last element, add new item
            if (i == -1 || result[i][1] < interval[0]) {
                result[++i] = interval;
            } else {
                // merge the next
                result[i][1] = Math.max(result[i][1], interval[1]);
            }
        }
        return Arrays.copyOf(result, i + 1);
    }
```
