##818. Race Car - hard - https://leetcode.com/problems/race-car/
```
Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line.  (Your car can go into negative positions.)

Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions A (accelerate) and R (reverse).

When you get an instruction "A", your car does the following: position += speed, speed *= 2.

When you get an instruction "R", your car does the following: if your speed is positive then speed = -1 , otherwise speed = 1.  (Your position stays the same.)

For example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to positions 0->1->3->3, and your speed goes to 1->2->4->-1.

Now for some target position, say the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.

Example 1:
Input: 
target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AA".
Your position goes from 0->1->3.
Example 2:
Input: 
target = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA".
Your position goes from 0->1->3->7->7->6.
 

Note:

1 <= target <= 10000.
