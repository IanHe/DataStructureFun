##198. House Robber - easy - https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/
```
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

 

Constraints:

    0 <= nums.length <= 100
    0 <= nums[i] <= 400
```
##Solution: DP - Bottom Up - Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1)
### Step 1: Divide into sub problems: suppose k houses index from 0 to k-1
### rob the K houses have two ways: 1. rob the previous (k-1) houses and leave the last one; 
###2: the best way rob the previous (k-2) housed and rob the last one;
### Step 2: So f(k) = max(f(k-1), f(k-2) + h(k-1)) and handle special condition: when k=0 return 0, when k=1, return H(0)
### Step 3: iterate Bottom-Up: f(0) = H(0), f(1) = Max(H(0), H(1)), f(2)=Max(f(1), f(0) + H(2)), f(3) = Max(f(2), f(1)+H(3))...
### Step 4: optimize space(optional), we don't have to use an array to store all maximum values from House 1 to House K
### only f(n-1), f(n-2) which is prev and (prev of prev) is necessary
```
Code:
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;
        if (nums.length == 1) return nums[0];

        int prev = nums[0];  // prev represent k-2
        int cur = Math.max(prev, nums[1]); // cur represent k-1
        for (int i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int max = Math.max(cur, prev + nums[i]);
            prev = cur;
            cur = max;
        }
        return cur;
    }
```
