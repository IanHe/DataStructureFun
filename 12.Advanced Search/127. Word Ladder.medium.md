127. Word Ladder - medium - https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/word-ladder/
```
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

    Only one letter can be changed at a time.
    Each transformed word must exist in the word list.

Note:

    Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
    All words have the same length.
    All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
    You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
    You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.

Example 1:

Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.

Example 2:

Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.

### Solution 1 - BFS (refer to 07.DFS & BFS)
### Solution 2 - Two-ended BFS
#### Time Complexity: O(M*N), Space Complexity: O(M*N) - M is the word length, N is the count of the words

Code:
    public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
        // Use set to replace wordList, search word in Set is O(1), search word in List is O(n)
        Set<String> wordSet = new HashSet<>(wordList);
        if (wordSet.size() == 0 || !wordSet.contains(endWord)) {
            return 0;
        }

        // all visited record
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();

        // define sets on two end
        Set<String> beginSet = new HashSet<>(), endSet = new HashSet<>();
        beginSet.add(beginWord);
        endSet.add(endWord);

        int len = beginWord.length();
        int step = 1;
        // BFS starts

                    char originChar = charArray[i];
                    for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {
                        if (originChar == c) {

                        String nextWord = String.valueOf(charArray);
                        if (wordSet.contains(nextWord)) {
                            if (endSet.contains(nextWord)) {
                                return step + 1;
                            }
                            if (!visited.contains(nextWord)) {
                                nextLevelVisited.add(nextWord);
                                visited.add(nextWord);

                        }
                    }
                    // set back state
                    charArray[i] = originChar;
                }
            }

            // use next level set to search
            beginSet = nextLevelVisited;
            step++;
        }
