##200. Number of Islands - medium - https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/
```
Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

### Solution: DFS
#### Time Complexity: O(M*N), Space Complexity: O(M*N) -- M, M is the rows and columns of the grid
```
Code:
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int row = grid.length;
        int column = grid[0].length;
        int num = 0;
        for (int x = 0; x < row; x++) {
            for (int y = 0; y < column; y++) {
                if (grid[x][y] == '1') {
                    num++;
                    dfs(grid, x, y);
                }
            }
        }
        return num;
    }

    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int x, int y) {
        int row = grid.length;
        int column = grid[0].length;

        // terminator
        if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= row || y >= column || grid[x][y] == '0') {
            return;
        }

        grid[x][y] = '0';
        // dfs to children
        dfs(grid, x - 1, y);
        dfs(grid, x, y - 1);
        dfs(grid, x + 1, y);
        dfs(grid, x, y + 1);
    }
